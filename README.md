# Double Integral Computation

This repository contains Python code to compute and visualize double integrals of functions using symbolic mathematics. The code uses the SymPy library for symbolic computation and IPython for LaTeX rendering in Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview

The provided Python function computes the double integral of a given function over specified ranges for \( x \) and \( y \). It displays the procedure step-by-step, including:

- Displaying the original function.
- Computing the integral with respect to \( x \).
- Computing the integral with respect to \( y \).
- Showing the final result.
- Detailed breakdown of the integration process.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:
- `sympy` for symbolic mathematics.
- `IPython` for LaTeX rendering in Jupyter notebooks.

Install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install sympy ipython
```
